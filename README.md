ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm a curious guy diving into backend development and with a strong interest in social change and open source. In my free time I also enjoy making music and reading more books that I can finish. 

Currently learning REST API development with Flask and contributing to my first open source project, Grimoirelab.
